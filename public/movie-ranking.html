<hr/>
<h3>AVATAR</h3>
<p>Popularly called Avatar: Blue monkey for its blue characters, I think this is a really good movie cos of all the elements contained therein</p>
<h3>THE MESSAGE</h3>
<p>I first saw The Message as a kid and have gone on to watch a few other variations and languages and it almost perfectly captures the Muhammad's Message and origins of Islam in an objective way. leaves out too few things. Loved it.</p>
<h3>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN</h3>
<p>They say no movie has captured the realities and happenings in war as much as this has and none will too. It reminds us of the reality of war and fraigility of human life. I knew after my first watch that i don't wanna ever be in a battle. I like being alive.</p>
